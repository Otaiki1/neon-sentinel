## 📖 The Story

### The Grid

Inside a collapsing digital megasystem called **The Grid**, autonomous security programs—**Neon Sentinels**—fight to contain a spreading corruption known as **The Swarm**.

### The Infection

Each enemy color represents a deeper layer of system corruption. You don't "beat levels"—you push deeper into infected layers of the system until you hit a system collapse (death). The deeper you go, the more dangerous the corruption becomes.

### Your Mission

As a Neon Sentinel, your mission is to:
- **Survive** as long as possible
- **Push deeper** into corrupted system layers
- **Defeat graduation bosses** to unlock new layers
- **Climb the leaderboards** and become a Grid Defender

---

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls

#### Desktop
- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**: Move your Sentinel
- **Spacebar** or **Mouse Click**: Shoot bullets
- **Q**: Activate Overclock Mode
- **ESC**: Pause/Resume game
- **R**: Restart (when game over)
- **M**: Return to Menu

#### Mobile
- **Virtual Joystick**: Move your Sentinel
- **Fire Button**: Shoot
- **Pause Button**: Top-right
- **Landscape mode recommended** for better gameplay

### Gameplay Basics

1. **Movement**: Your Sentinel starts near the bottom-left of the screen. Move with WASD or arrow keys to dodge enemies and their bullets.

2. **Shooting**: Press Spacebar/click on desktop or hold the Fire button on mobile. Bullets travel horizontally to the right to hit enemies spawning from the right side.

3. **Enemies**: Enemies spawn from the right side and move toward you. They bounce off the top, bottom, and left walls. Destroy them with your bullets to score points.

4. **Lives**: You start with **1 life**. Collect **Life Orbs** (purple orbs) to gain 2 additional lives each. There's no cap on lives—collect as many as you can!

5. **Collisions**: If an enemy touches you, you lose **1 life**. The enemy does NOT die—only you take damage. You have a brief invincibility period after taking damage.

6. **Game Over**: The game ends when your lives reach **0**. Your score is automatically submitted to the weekly leaderboard.

**Q: What happens when I die?**  
A: Your score is automatically submitted to the weekly leaderboard. You can restart or return to the menu.

**Q: Do power-ups stack?**  
A: Some do (Firepower), but most replace the previous one. Check the power-up descriptions above.

**Q: Why can't I progress past a layer?**  
A: You must defeat the graduation boss that spawns when you reach the score threshold.

- **Cycle**: Return to Layer 1 with higher difficulty and score multipliers
- **Scaling**: Multipliers increase each cycle; there’s no cap
- **Visuals**: Grid hue shifts, glitch jitter, and screen flashes intensify
- **Badge**: "Prestige Champion" appears when you reach Prestige 10

---

## 🧠 Dynamic Difficulty Evolution

Enemy behavior evolves over time, not just by score:

- **Phase 1 (0-3 min)**: Simple pursuit and random spawns
- **Phase 2 (3-8 min)**: Predictive movement begins
- **Phase 3 (8-15 min)**: Coordinated fire and formation waves
- **Phase 4 (15+ min)**: Adaptive learning shifts spawn lanes

Tips:
- Change direction often to reduce predictive accuracy
- Avoid camping edges; it biases spawns to trap you
- Watch for formation waves and coordinated fire windows

---

## 🧪 Corruption Meter

Corruption is a global risk-reward meter (0-100) that rises over time:

- **Low (0-25%)**: 1.0x score, standard enemies
- **Medium (25-50%)**: 1.5x score, tougher enemies
- **High (50-75%)**: 2.0x score, aggressive enemies
- **Critical (75-100%)**: 3.0x score, very dangerous enemies

How it changes:
- **Passive rise**: Increases every second
- **Risk bonuses**: Corrupted zones (dense enemies), boss kills, no-hit streaks, high combos
- **Safe play**: Corruption slowly decays if you only farm low-risk enemies

Tips:
- Push corruption when you’re confident for big score gains
- Mix movement patterns to survive at high corruption
- Reset pressure with safer play after mistakes

---

## ⚡ Overclock Mode

Overclock Mode is a manual power surge you can trigger mid-run:

- **Activation**: Press `Q` (desktop)
- **Duration**: 15 seconds of boosted speed, fire rate, and score
- **Risk**: Enemy spawns increase during Overclock
- **Limits**: Cooldown between uses and a max number of activations per run

Tips:
- Use Overclock during dense waves or boss phases for max points
- Don’t trigger it when you’re low on lives or boxed in

---

## 🎯 Mid-Run Challenges

Mid-run challenges are short objectives that appear during a run:

- **Timing**: First challenge after ~1 minute, then every few minutes
- **Examples**: No-shoot survival, clean kill streaks, high-combo holds, bullet dodging
- **Rewards**: Bonus score, extra lives, or temporary multipliers
- **Failure**: No penalties—challenges simply expire

Tips:
- Commit to the objective once it appears for the best reward
- Skip safely if the arena state is too chaotic

---

## 🧬 Rotating Layer Modifiers

Some runs take place in special rotating layers that change every few hours:

- **Standard Grid**: Normal gameplay
- **Firewall Layer**: Movement speed capped at 70%
- **Memory Leak**: Random bursts of input delay and glitch flicker
- **Encrypted Zone**: Constant input lag (slower response)
- **Lag Spike**: Random short freezes that pause the action
- **The Void**: Limited vision around your Sentinel
- **Temporal Anomaly**: Faster movement grants extra score

Modifier tips:
- Plan movement around speed caps and input lag
- Keep space in The Void to avoid surprise hits
- In Temporal Anomaly, move faster for higher score bonuses

---

## 🧩 Almost Success Feedback

After game over, the HUD shows quick, personalized nudges like:

- How close you were to the next layer or score milestone
- The gap to the #10 leaderboard spot
- Whether higher corruption could have boosted your score
- New personal bests (kills, combo, corruption)

Use these hints to choose a target for your next run.

---

## 🧠 Kernel Playstyles

Before each run, choose a Kernel that changes how your Sentinel handles:

- **Standard Sentinel**: Balanced
- **Swift Interceptor**: Faster movement, slower fire rate
- **Artillery Unit**: Faster fire rate, slower movement
- **Guardian Core**: Extra durability per life
- **Sniper Kernel**: Piercing shots, much slower fire

Kernels are sidegrades, not upgrades—pick the one that fits your style.
