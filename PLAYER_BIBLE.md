## 📖 The Story

### The Grid

Inside a collapsing digital megasystem called **The Grid**, autonomous security programs—**Neon Sentinels**—fight to contain a spreading corruption known as **The Swarm**.

### The Infection

Each enemy color represents a deeper layer of system corruption. You don't "beat levels"—you push deeper into infected layers of the system until you hit a system collapse (death). The deeper you go, the more dangerous the corruption becomes.

### Your Mission

As a Neon Sentinel, your mission is to:
- **Survive** as long as possible
- **Push deeper** into corrupted system layers
- **Defeat graduation bosses** to unlock new layers
- **Climb the leaderboards** and become a Grid Defender
