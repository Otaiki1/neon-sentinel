## 🧠 Dynamic Difficulty Evolution

Enemy behavior evolves over time, not just by score:

- **Phase 1 (0-3 min)**: Simple pursuit and random spawns
- **Phase 2 (3-8 min)**: Predictive movement begins
- **Phase 3 (8-15 min)**: Coordinated fire and formation waves
- **Phase 4 (15+ min)**: Adaptive learning shifts spawn lanes

Tips:
- Change direction often to reduce predictive accuracy
- Avoid camping edges; it biases spawns to trap you
- Watch for formation waves and coordinated fire windows

---

## 🧪 Corruption Meter

Corruption is a global risk-reward meter (0-100) that rises over time:

- **Low (0-25%)**: 1.0x score, standard enemies
- **Medium (25-50%)**: 1.5x score, tougher enemies
- **High (50-75%)**: 2.0x score, aggressive enemies
- **Critical (75-100%)**: 3.0x score, very dangerous enemies

How it changes:
- **Passive rise**: Increases every second
- **Risk bonuses**: Corrupted zones (dense enemies), boss kills, no-hit streaks, high combos
- **Safe play**: Corruption slowly decays if you only farm low-risk enemies

Tips:
- Push corruption when you’re confident for big score gains
- Mix movement patterns to survive at high corruption
- Reset pressure with safer play after mistakes

---
